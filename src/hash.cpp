--------------------------------------------------------------------
lookup8.c, by Bob Jenkins, January 4 1997, Public Domain.
hash(), hash2(), hash3, and mix() are externally useful functions.
Routines to test the hash are included if SELF_TEST is defined.
You can use this free for any purpose.  It has no warranty.

2009: This is obsolete.  I recently timed lookup3.c as being faster
at producing 64-bit results.
